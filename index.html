							<h3>The first steps</h3>
							<p>I was born in October 31th, 1993 in a southern brazilian town called Florianopolis. As a child I was very agitated, slept little and had a lot of energy to spend. That led my father to enroll me in all different kind of sports such as taekwondo, football, horseback riding, and others. <br><br>Around 8 years old, my family and I moved to another city. This caused me to lose touch with my friends and classmates so I began to spend more time at home playing video games and computer games. <br><br> 
								It was at this time that I became fascinated by Computer Science.

							<h3>Germany And Other Challenges</h3>
							<p>In May of 2021 me and my wife moved to Germany. After months looking for a job I was able to get one but it wasn't exactly related to the field I was looking for so it didn't last long, although it was an amazing experience where I got to work with incredible people.<br><br>After another couple of months looking for other jobs I found myself asking some questions like "Is this what I really want to do?".<br><br>And from that moment on I began to study Web Development on my own. And I have been on this journey ever since January of 2022.  </p>

							<h3>The next steps</h3>
							<p>I discovered that my purpose is to work with Information Technology, because it's something that drives me forward always looking to improve my skill sets and my communication habilities.<br><br>At the moment I have a base foundation in HTML, CSS and JavaScript but I won't stop learning.<br><br>Changing my career path was and still is a challenge but I am proud of the decision I made and can't wait to show the world my potential. <br><br> <!--"Have the firm belief that the world will be on your side as long as you stay true to what is best in you."--></p>
